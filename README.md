I am using sustainable development goal number 11, make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable, as a year 12 student of Greymouth High School. Some of the product backlog includes managing finances and distribution. Expected timeline is the end of term 1 for the proposal and we expect to complete our prototype by term 2, term 3 will be used strictly for refining and improving our final product to be ready to be used. The project that we are currently working on is towards making the city a more sustainable place, we are building this around sustainable development goal 11 as this relates to our aim of the project to make the grey district a healthier environment. We will have the help of Ms. Chowfin who will be our project manager and will have the reliability of our stakeholders to always help improve our project. These stakeholders will be Samantha Mortimer, the principal of Greymouth High School, and Tony Negri, a manager at the grey star and the father of a member in my team.
